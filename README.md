# self-lifter
A program that transforms user-provided scripts into new scripts that can output their own source code.

Three facts can be used to demonstrate Gödel's incompleteness theorems. First, there exists a program that can obtain its own code. Second, a Turing machine can be encoded into a first-order logic sentence. Third, there is an algorithm to search for proofs of first-order logic sentences (proofs are recognizable). This repository is a small demonstration of the first fact.

> We consider a paradox that arises in the study of life. It concerns the possibility of making machines that can construct replicas of themselves. The paradox can be summarized in the following manner.
>
> 1. Living things are machines.
> 2. Living things can self-reproduce.
> 3. Machines cannot self-reproduce.
>
> Statement 1 is a tenet of modern biology. We believe that organisms operate in a mechanistic way. 
>
> Statement 2 is obvious. The ability to self-reproduce is an essential characteristic of every biological species. 
>
> For statement 3, we make the following argument that machines cannot self-reproduce. Consider a machine that constructs other machines, such as an automated factory that produces cars. Raw materials go in at one end, the manufacturing robots follow a set of instructions, and then completed vehicles come out the other end. We claim that the factory must be more complex than the cars produced, in the sense that designing the factory would be more difficult than designing a car. This claim must be true because the factory itself has the car’s design within it, in addition to the design of all the manufacturing robots. The same reasoning applies to any machine A that constructs a machine B: A must be more complex than B. But a machine cannot be more complex than itself. Consequently, no machine can construct itself, and thus self-reproduction is impossible.
